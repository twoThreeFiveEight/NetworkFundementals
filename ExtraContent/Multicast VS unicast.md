Multicast and unicast are two different types of network communication. 

Unicast is a one-to-one communication model, where data is sent from a single sender to a single receiver. In this model, the sender sends a message to a specific IP address, and the message is delivered only to the device with that IP address. 

Multicast, on the other hand, is a one-to-many communication model, where data is sent from a single sender to multiple receivers. In this model, the sender sends a message to a multicast IP address, and the message is delivered to all devices that have joined that multicast group. 

Multicast is often used for applications such as video streaming, where multiple users may want to receive the same data simultaneously. Unicast, on the other hand, is used for applications such as web browsing or email, where data is sent to a specific recipient. 

It's worth noting that there is also a third type of network communication called "broadcast", where data is sent from a single sender to all devices on a network. However, broadcast is less commonly used today due to its potential for network congestion and security vulnerabilities
