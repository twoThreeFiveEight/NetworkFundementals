How are we going to actually be remoting into these devices? Can we use Linux? Or do we need to specifically use MobaXterm and putty?

What you need to be aware of

	Companies will ahve different levels of security and if you are using another computer on site, you might not have access to your own tools.

	Would not look bad to ask someone if you could get something set up on site, if you are working there consistently on contract and it will improve
your workflow

	Bottom line - even with with security protocols, most companies will be accomodating if you need it. Security can get pretty beaurocratic though.

	IN SUMMARY: It is okay to ask.



Supports the Field engineers

	Company goes and orders a bunch of hardware - support contracts

	Expectation - field engineers are responsible for the contract, and call escalation for support

What would you want to ask yourself 10 years ago if you were in our position?

	What he wished he wanted to know at the beginning:

		The importance of packet flow - Deeply understanding the process. Step by step what happens to the packet. 

		Helping us out with a visual. If you can visually represent a packet with its headers and payloads

		Packet Flow = [[How the data changes at every point as it moves through the network.]]

TTL - every time it goes through a hop



OSI Model 

Application layer contains the presentation and session layer.

HTTPS is HTTP in an ssh tunnel.

Tunneling 

Almost like you need a new layer 2 header in order to get around a new broadcast domain.


switchport access mode

any traffic that enters the intrerface, any traffic that goes in on that interface is going to be on that vlan
